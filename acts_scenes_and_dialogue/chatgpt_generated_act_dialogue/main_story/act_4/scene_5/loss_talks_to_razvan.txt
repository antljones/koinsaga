I might let you leave Helix, but it'll cost you."  },  {    "speaker": "Razvan",    "message": "I don't have much, sir. I can't just give you a coin."  },  {    "speaker": "Loss",    "message": "Then I guess you'll have to stay in Helix for a little while longer. I'm sure we can find some work for you to do to pay off your debt."  },  {    "speaker": "Razvan",    "message": "Please, sir. I need that coin to get to the next town.

There must be some other way."  },  {    "speaker": "Loss",    "message": "I suppose there is another way. You could try to steal from me, but I wouldn't recommend it. I have eyes and ears all over Helix, and if you're caught, the punishment will be severe."  },  {    "speaker": "Razvan",    "message": "I wouldn't dream of stealing from you, sir. I just need to keep that coin for myself."  },  {    "speaker": "Loss",    "message": "Well then, it looks like you'll be staying in Helix for a while. I'll let my associates know to keep an eye on you."  },  {    "speaker": "Razvan",    "message": "Thank you, sir. I'll make sure to stay out of trouble."  },  {    "speaker": "Loss",    "message": "Good. It's better for both of us that way. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some business to attend to."  }]
