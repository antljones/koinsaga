      "speaker": "River",

    {
      "speaker": "Gypsum",
      "text": "That's so true, River. It makes me so angry to see that someone can cause so much harm without even thinking twice about it. It's not just about the loss of powers, but also the harm it causes to the individual and the communities they're a part of."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "River",
      "text": "I understand your anger, Gypsum. But we have to remember that anger and hatred will not solve this problem. We need to come together and find a solution that benefits everyone and protects the diversity of powers and abilities."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Gypsum",
      "text": "You're right, River. We need to find a way to protect those with powers and abilities while also addressing the root cause of the problem. We can't just react with anger and aggression. We need to be proactive and come up with a plan that will prevent this from happening in the future."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "River",
      "text": "Exactly, Gypsum. We need to educate people and raise awareness about the importance of diversity and the consequences of their actions. Only then will we be able to create a better future for everyone."
